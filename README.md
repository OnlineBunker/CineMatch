# 🎬 CineMatch

CineMatch is a backend-focused movie discovery platform built to explore clean API design, authentication flows, and scalable database-driven applications. The project prioritizes **structure, correctness, and extensibility** over surface-level features.

At its current stage, CineMatch functions as a **solid backend system** for a movie-based application, with clear scope for future expansion.

---

## 🚀 What CineMatch Does (Current State)

* User authentication (register & login)
* Secure session handling using JWT
* Movie data retrieval through REST APIs
* Genre-based filtering and querying
* Database-backed design using Prisma ORM
* Clean separation of concerns (routes, controllers, middleware)

This is **not** a frontend-heavy or AI-powered project yet — and that’s intentional.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

CineMatch was built to:

* Practice real-world backend architecture
* Work with relational databases properly (not toy JSON storage)
* Understand authentication, middleware, and request lifecycles
* Build something extensible instead of a one-off script

Think of it as a **backend foundation**, not a finished product.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **Prisma ORM**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **JWT Authentication**

The stack was chosen for clarity, control, and industry relevance — not trend chasing.

---

## 📡 API Capabilities (High-Level)

* User registration and login
* Auth-protected routes
* Movie listing and filtering
* Clean error handling and status codes

Endpoints are intentionally kept minimal and readable.

---

## 🔮 Planned / Upcoming Changes (Explicitly Not Implemented Yet)

The following are **planned ideas**, not current features:

* Recommendation logic based on user behavior
* Watch history tracking
* Rating-based sorting
* Frontend integration (React / Next.js)
* Advanced filtering and personalization
* Deployment & containerization

Any AI/ML-based recommendation system will be explored **only after** the backend is production-stable.
